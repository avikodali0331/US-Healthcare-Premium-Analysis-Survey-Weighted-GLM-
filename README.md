# US Healthcare Premium Analysis (Survey-Weighted GLM)
This project analyzes data from the 2024 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to identify the demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related factors that drive private health insurance premium costs in the United States.

Using R, we performed a complete statistical analysis pipeline—from data cleaning and complex survey design implementation to generalized linear modeling (GLM) and variable selection. The final model quantifies how factors like anxiety, sexual orientation, and lifestyle choices impact insurance costs.
